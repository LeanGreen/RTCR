# Change Log

## [0.4.0]
### Added
- filter to umi_group_ec. Reads that are too dissimilar to an existing
consensus sequence with the same UMI, are discarded if their score (from
get_offset method) is less than "min_score4merge".
- progress indicator for umi_group_ec.
- progress indicator for QMerge&IMerge, and NMerge
- "output_hdr" and "output_fmt" options to config.ini for customization of the
way clones are output to text (currently ".tsv") files.
- "rtcr Convert" option. Converts pickled clonesets (.dat files) to text
(.tsv files).
### Fixed
- Pipeline exits when child process dies (instead of waiting indefinitely for
results).
- config.ini, by default thread name is included in log messages
- test_RTCR.py tests the run_umi_group_ec method.
- UMI record format is now "UMI:XXX:YYY:ZZZ" where XXX is the qualifier (e.g.
"R1"), and YYY and ZZZ are the UMI nt sequence and ascii encoded (Phred+33)
base quality scores. This fixes an issue as the base quality string (here the
ZZZ part) contains the delimiter (":", i.e. Phred 25).
- align.py minimally assigns one thread to the V and J alignment processes, so
running RTCR with number of threads set to one ('-t 1' option) no longer
causes a broken pipe ("IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe"), which happened
because the J-alignment process would be given 0 threads to work with in
align.py.
- trie.py now removes nodes in Trie.__delitem__ function  without throwing
AttributeError when trying to access the node.isset attribute (added
Node.clear() function which itself resets the Node._isset attribute).
- Update author email in setup.py to gmail account
- Requirement of python 2.7+ in setup.py (python_require option)
## [0.3.2]
### Added
- Change log
- command line arguments (sys.argv) in pipeline log output (rtcr.log)
### Changed
- Checkout can handle three file inputs with forward, reverse, or merged
reads. Output will be "_R1.fastq" and "_R2.fastq" for master and slave
containing reads in the case of forward and reverse fastq files. Output will be
"_R12.fastq" for merged read pairs.
- Checkout adds a qualifier ("R1", "R2", or "R12") to each UMI
- umi_group_ec handles UMI qualifiers for separating out forward, reverse,
and merged read pairs.
### Fixed
- Checkout now reports "100%" when it has finished processing all
the reads.
- Pipeline responds to CTRL-C
- Suppresses 'No handlers could be found for logger' message when using rtcr
libraries without configuring a logger.
- build_clone method in clone.py no longer accepts 0 length junction nt seqs,
this prevents "ValueError: len(seq) < 1" from ConsensusQSequence (in cseq.c)
- Outputs warning to log when no germline mismatches are found, instead of
causing 'float division by zero'.
- align.py now uses unique identifiers to keep track of the reads, separate
from the read names. This prevents from potentially pasting different reads
together when read names in a fastq file are not unique. This includes the
case where read names are not unique before the first space (as bowtie2 drops
everything after the first space).
